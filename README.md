# Open Interview Coder

You know about the Interview Coder guy who made invisible AI window? 🫠🫠🫠 I don't like the fact that he taking advantage of poor job market and rip off poor students 😐😐. I rather make a fair game for everyone. I reverse engineering it and his whole thing was based on one functionality: `setContentProtection` from electron https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window

- Use node 20.19.0
- Test on Google Meet, Discord and screenshots
```
npm run build
npm start
```

```
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A pressed: toggling window visibility
```

oh and I forgot, what he say: `F Interview Coder` hahaha

Future feature:
