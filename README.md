# Open Interview Coder

You know about the Interview Coder guy who made invisible AI window? I don't like the fact that he taking advantage of poor job market and rip off poor students. I rather make a fair game for everyone. His whole thing was based on 1 functionality: `setContentProtection` from electron https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window

- Use node 20.19.0
- Test on Google Meet, Discord and screenshots
```
npm run build
npm start
```
oh and I forgot, what he say: `F Interview Coder` hahaha
